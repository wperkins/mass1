## Description

MASS1 is a one-dimensional unsteady hydrodynamic and water quality
model capable of simulating open channel flows, water surface
elevations, dissolved gas, and water temperature. The model is
applicable to any branched channel system. Because MASS1 uses
cross-section averaging, only single values of water surface
elevation, velocity, discharge, and temperature are produced at each
cross-section location along the river course. Lateral (i.e., across
the river channel) and vertical variations of these quantities are not
simulated.  

MASS1 was developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
(PNNL). It is a research code, written for applications and computer
platforms specific to the developers.  Others may, or may not,
find it useful.  

## Obtaining the Code

The MASS1 source code is currently hosted on PNNL's internal Git
repository.  Do the following to check out the code:

```
git clone https://stash.pnnl.gov/scm/~d3g096/mass1.git
cd mass1
```

## Requirements

MASS1 has been used primarily on UNIX, Linux, and Mac OS X
systems. The following describes how to build MASS1 on those
platforms.  It has been built and used on Windows systems, but rarely.
The following should work on Windows if [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/)
or [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) is utilized.  A native Windows build
may be available in the future. 

### Fortran 2003/2008 compiler

MASS1 is written in Fortran and makes use of several
[Fortran 2003](http://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/Fortran+2003)
constructs.  Consistently, a Fortran compiler that conforms to the
2003 standard is required to build MASS1. The following compilers are
known to work:

* [GNU Fortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/), Version 5.3 or higher 

* [Intel Fortran](https://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers),
  Version 15 or higher

In general, the Intel compiler produces a faster executable, but for
most applications, this is not noticable. In the past, Fortran
compilers from [NAG](https://www.nag.com/nag-compiler),
[Absoft](https://www.absoft.com/),
[IBM](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/xlfortran-linux), and
others have worked, but they are no longer used.  

## Optional Software

### Gnuplot

[Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) is used to plot MASS1 test
results.  If [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) is not found on the
system, tests can still be run, but the results will not be plotted.  

### Perl

Several optional [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) pre/post-processing
scripts are provided.  These use the following
[Perl](https://www.perl.org/) modules:

* `Date::Manip`

* `PDL`

* `PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window`

When MASS1 code is configured, the system's
[Perl](https://www.perl.org/) installation is queried to see if the
scripts can be used. If not, the scripts are not configured or
installed.  

### Python

In addition to the Perl scripts, some optional
[Python](https://www.python.org/) pre/post-processing scripts are also
provided.  

### R

There is an optional [R](https://www.r-project.org/) script for
reading MASS1 time series output and boundary condition files. 

### Tecplot

[Tecplot](https://www.tecplot.com/) is a commercial visualization
software package.  There is a script to build
[Tecplot](https://www.tecplot.com/) input files from MASS1 profile
output. It is used to make some profile animations in a few
test cases. It's use is optional.  

## Configure and Build

MASS1 uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) cross-platform tools to
configure and build MASS1.  CMake queries  the system
and determine if the compiler has sufficient capability to compile
MASS1 and if optional software is available.  This works well on Mac
and Linux systems, and should work on Windows, but the authors do not
use or develop MASS1 on Windows.  

A typical configuration and build:

1. In the top MASS1 source directory (where `CMakeLists.txt` is
   located), make a directory for the build, called `build` maybe, and
   change into that directory.
   
2. If necessary, choose the Fortran compiler to use by setting `FC`
   and `FCFLAGS` environment variables. This is recommended, because
   [CMake](https://cmake.org/) will work very hard to choose the wrong
   compiler. For example, in a Bourne-like shell,

```
mkdir build
cd build
FC=gfortran
export FC
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release ..
```

3. To build MASS1, just run `make` in the `build` directory


4. (Optional) Run tests. The `test` subdirectory contains several
   tests and examples of various MASS1 capabilities.  Many of these
   tests can be run with
   
```
make runtests
```

   This will run a number of tests. The simulation output is not
   actually checked, but if these tests run, output is usually
   correct.  A number of graphics are created (if
   [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) is available) for the tests.
   Browse the `build/test` directory after `make runtests`
   completion.
   
### OpenMP

MASS1 can utilize [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) to partially
parallelize computations.  This can provide significant speed up of
large networks on multi-processor platforms.  To enable, add 

```
-D MASS1_ENABLE_OPENMP:BOOL=ON
```
to the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) command. 

MASS1 utilizes [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) to parallelize the
computation of links with the same order.  So, OpenMP really only
helps with large networks with hundreds or thousands of links and a large
order range.  OpenMP can help with transport in smaller network,
particularly if small transport time steps are needed, but the
benefits are much lower.  

The number of threads used needs to be limited. The benefits of OpenMP
are usually lost with more than just a few threads.  Of course, some
experimentation is needed for a particular application.  The maximum
number of threads is set using the environment variable
`OMP_NUM_THREADS`, e.g.,

```
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
export OMP_NUM_THREADS
```
before running MASS1.   Using too many threads will make MASS1 run
slower.  


## Usage

MASS1 is a *command line* application. There is no graphical user
interface.  All [input and output](doc/README.md) are plain text files
(except hotstart files). There is very little
[documentation](doc/README.md), other than the
code itself.  

The first step in a MASS1 application is to define the topology of the
river system to be simulated. The topological definition defines how
the channel system is connected as well as the location and type of
hydraulic control structures. The domain into a set of *links*, each
representing a single river reach. The ends of each link either
represent a boundary, at which river conditions are specified, or
connect to one or more other links. Each link is further divided into
series of computational points, where the hydrodynamic and transport
equations are discretized.  


When run, MASS1 expects to find a
[configuration file](doc/configuration.md) named `mass1.cfg` in the
current directory
